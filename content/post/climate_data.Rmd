Below are links to some preformatted data set related to the presentations you gave last Friday about our changing climate. I have taken the raw data files and made them neat for plotting. If you feel confident with the plotting you should try and work up the data from the raw version.

Your job today is to pick a data set, load it in, and explore the data and ways you might be able to plot it that would make sense. Think about what we've covered so far in terms of creating geoms, formatting plots and playing around with presentation.

In the next few days, you will build the context around these plots and create a presentation of the data and it's context.

**Note on wrangling**

If you feel like you would enjoy the challenge of working up the data from the raw data provided on the websites of any of the data sets, you should refer to the [Wrangle Chapter](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/wrangle-intro.html) or R for Data Science, especially the [Data Import](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-import.html) and [Tidy data](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html) chapters. There's a whole slew of tools you will need to massage the data into a nice format, but some of the key things will be:

- Using the `read_csv()`, `read_tsv()`, or `read_delim()` functions and looking at the additional arguments that can be passed to these
- Potentially forcing a column to a numeric using `as.numeric()`
- Using `mutate()` to create new columns in your data frame (potentially from existing data in the frame)
- The `lubridate` package creates data-time formats from a variety of inputs (see [Lubridate](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/dates-and-times.html) chapter in R for Data Science)
- `gather()` function can take data spread over multiple columns and bring it into one place. This is especially useful if your data is organized with year on the row names and months in the columns.
- `readxl` package has a `read_excel()` function for reading in Excel datasheets

# Atmospheric CO2

I got the Mauna loa data set from the [Keeling group page](http://scrippsco2.ucsd.edu/data/atmospheric_co2/), but you can also get it from [NOAA](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/data.html). The Keeling group page also has data sets from other stations, but note that this data would need to be wrangled into the right format for plotting. 

- [Mauna Loa CO2 CSV](../../climatedata/csv/CO2_mauna_loa.csv)
- [Bering Head CO2 CSV](../../climatedata/csv/CO2_bering_head.csv)
- [Mauna Loa CO2 RAW](../../climatedata/raw/monthly_in_situ_co2_mlo.csv)
- [Bering Head CO2 RAW](../../climatedata/raw/monthly_flask_co2_nzd.csv)

> How is it best to plot Atmospheric CO2 changes?

> Can you plot multiple records on the same plot?

> Can you add this data onto the CO2 record from paleo?

# Sea Ice

Data is from [NSIDC](https://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/sea-ice-tools/) in excel format. 

- [Sea ice record CSV](../../climatedata/csv/sea_ice_extent.csv)
- [Sea ice record RAW](../../climatedata/raw/Sea_Ice_Index_Daily_Extent_G02135_v3.0.xlsx)

> How best to show such a seasonally varying signal and the changes?

> Can you plot the trend lines for different seasons?

> How can you measure the magnitude of the changes?

# Paleo Records

Data is from Antarctic ice cores and can be accessed via [CDIAC](https://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/trends/co2/ice_core_co2.html) which will take you to the [NOAA Ice Core data site](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/paleoclimatology-data/datasets/ice-core). CO2 data recovered from this (data page)[https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo-search/study/6091]. Data is a combination of records from a few cores - raw data file and site have all relavent metadata. Temperature data found [here](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo-search/study/6080). Temperature value is relative to the average over the past 1000 years.

- [CO2 Paleo Record CSV](../../climatedata/csv/paleo_co2.csv)
- [Temp Paleo Record CSV](../../climatedata/csv/paleo_temp.csv)
- [CO2 Paleo Record RAW](../../climatedata/raw/edc-co2-2008.txt)
- [Temp Paleo Record RAW](../../climatedata/raw/edc3deuttemp2007.txt)

> Can you combine the records below and show how they co-vary?

> Can you add them to the modern record?

> How best to indicate and explain the patterns you see?

> Can you find data for the earths orbital parameters (maybe [here](https://biocycle.atmos.colostate.edu/shiny/Milankovitch/))?


# Surface Temperature

Data is temperature anomalies compiled by NASA and available on their [website](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/). Also some good [FAQs](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/faq/abs_temp.html) about how this is calculated. These anomalies are calculated relative to the baseline period 1951 -- 1980.

- [Air surface temp raw RAW](../../climatedata/raw/climate_raw/surftemp_NASA.csv)

> What do we understand by "temperature anomaly"?

> Can you join this record up with the paleo record?

> How best to indicate the baseline period?


# Ocean Acidification

pH and carbonate chem data can be accessed from either the [BATS data site](http://bats.bios.edu/bats-data/) or the [HOTS data site](http://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/hot-dogs/interface.html) for data in the Atlantic and Pacific respectively. A good raw data version of the surface carbonate chemistry in the Pacific can be found [here](http://hahana.soest.hawaii.edu/hot/products/products.html) 

- [Surface Carb Chem HOTS CSV](../../climatedata/csv/surface_co2.csv)
- [Surface Carb Chem HOTS RAW](../../climatedata/raw/climate_raw/HOT_surface_CO2.txt)

> What is the trend in pH?

> How do we make sense of all the variables we can plot?

> Can we incorporate the Mauna Loa data into our plots?

# Sea Level Rise

Data is from [CSIRO](https://www.cmar.csiro.au/sealevel/sl_data_cmar.html) and includes both modern altimeter data and past reconstrutions of sea level rise.

- [Sea Level Rise CSV](../../climatedata/csv/gmsl.csv)
- [Sea level Rise (recon) RAW](../../climatedata/raw/CSIRO_Recons_gmsl_mo_2015.csv)
- [Sea level Rise (alti) RAW](../../climatedata/raw/CSIRO_ALT_gmsl_mo_2015.csv)

> How were these two datasets compiled?

> How well do they agree?

# Upper Ocean Temperature

Data is from [NOAA](https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/3M_HEAT_CONTENT/basin_avt_data.html). It is the three-monthly average of upper 100 m ocean temperature for the vaious ocean basins and globally. 

- [Upper-ocean temperatures CSV](../../climatedata/csv/ocean_temp.csv)
- [Upper-ocean temperatures RAW](../../climatedata/raw/T-dC-w0-100m.dat)

> How do the oceans compare?

> Can you download and bring in data from other depths?

# Ice Mass Balance

Data is from [IMBIE](http://imbie.org/data-downloads/), which has annual mass loss from both Greenland and Antarctica to 2012 in one combined excel workbook. They also have a more updated Antarctic extimate and, coming soon, and update Greenland one. Here, I include the combined data set.

- [Icesheet mass balance Greenland CSV](../../climatedata/csv/greenland_MB.csv)
